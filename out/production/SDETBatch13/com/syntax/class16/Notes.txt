There are 3 types of variables in Java: Local, Instance and Static.

Local Variables:
   Are the variables which are created inside block of code like method, loop, switch statement, if else condition or a
   constructor.
   Pros:
   -We should always to prefer local variables over instance or static variables because they live for the shortest period of time
   Cons:
   -They can't be accessed outside of the block of code in which they are created


Class Test{
void USA(){
String person="Elisa Bro";

}
void France(){
System.out.println(person) //we will get an error because right now "person" is only accessible in USA method
}
}

Instance Variables:(object level)
  -They are created inside of class but outside the block of code.
  Pros:
  -Accessible everywhere in a class in all blocks of code inside that class but not in a static method.
  Cons:
  -They keep occupying memory for longer period of type.

Static Variables:(Class level)
  -If we have an instance variable with a STATIC key word then it is called static variable
  Pros:
  -The Highest Scope, available outside an object (across the object of a class)
  and they are class level variables, it doesn't matter how many objects we create in that class only one variable is created.
  -If we know the value stays same for all the objects of the class we should ALWAYS go with STATIC variable, that way we
  can say a lot of memory.
  Cons:
  -They occupy the memory for the longest period of time
  -They can hold only a single for all the objects.
