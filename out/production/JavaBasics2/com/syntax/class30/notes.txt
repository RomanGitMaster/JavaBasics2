Maps in Java:
   is an interface in java that allows to store key-value pairs.

   There are many types of Map Interface as sets but we will only discuss 3 of them:
   1) HashMap; 2)LinkedHashMap; 3)TreeMap;

   HashMap:(just like with HashSet)
     Upside: it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data.
     Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.

   LinkedHashMap:(just like with LinkedHashSet)
     Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
     Downside: Insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrieval speed is the slowest( it has to go through many
                 connected memory nods thats why insertion speed is slow).

   TreeMap:(just like with TreeSet)
     Upside: The data is stored in the sorted form( it means whenever we insert new value th sorting happens at the same moment,
                        which means insertion speed will be very slow, each element that we insert first have to locate it's proper position
                        where it should be stored )
     Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap, but slower than HashMap
   HashTable:
     its old and slow but provide thread safety.

 Important Note:
   We can use three methods to get the data from a map
   1)EntrySet:key,value store inside an object of type Map. we can use getKey() method on this object to get a key of that entry and getValue()
    to get value of that entry
   2) keySet() :it will return all the keys from a map in the form of a set
   3) value(): It will return us all the values from a map in the form of a collection.

FileHandling in java:
    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of the file that we want to read/write
    2) we need to navigate to that file.
    3) we need to have a software installed on our computers to interact with that file.

    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file Manually.
    1) Path of a file we can store inside a String
    2) we can use the FIleInputStream/FileOutputStream class to navigate to that folder.
    3) we use a specific java class that can handle that file type
