what is super keyword:
   Is used to refer to the parent class object.
why should we learn about super keyword?
   1) if we have same name variable or method int the parent/super/base class then we can use the super keyword to refer
   to parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the variables of child class. We can call the super class
   constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super();

How to use super keyword:
   1) we can use super. method name or field name to call the method or access field of super class.
   2) we can also use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.

Rules:
   1) we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super keyword.
   2) we can only use super() inside a constructor
   3) if we have a  user created constructor in parent class we must have a matching  paremeter constructor inside
     the child as well.
   4) if we have multiple constructors inside the parent as soon as one is matched we are good to go.
      We don't need to match each and every constructor from the parent class
   5) super () should be the first line inside the constructor

WHat is MethodOverLoading?
    When same name method in a class but with different number of parameters or different type of parameters or different
    sequence of parameters it is called methodOverLoading
Why we should use method overloading?
    1) Makes your code more readable.
    2) Makes the life of the end users easy they don't have to memorize many method names.
How can we use MethodOverLoading?
    We can have same method name, but we have to follow below rules:
    1) by passing different numbers of parameters;
    2) we can change data type;
    3) we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters;
