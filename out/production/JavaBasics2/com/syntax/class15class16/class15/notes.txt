WHAT is the Method?
 Method in Java is a block of code(group of Java statements). It defines behavior of a class.

WHY should we use Method?
  1)It helps us remove the duplicate code from our application.
  2)We just create a method and every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
  3)It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of large applications easier.

HOW to use Methods?
  1)First we create a method inside the class
  2)We create the object of that class
  3)We call the method by writing the name of the object, a dot and name of the Method

  class Calculator{


  void add(int x, int y) {
System.out.println(x+y);
  }

  }

  public static void main(String[] args){

  Calculator md=new Calculator();
md.add(10,20);
  }

RULES how to create and use METHODS:
  void add(int x, int y) {
  System.out.println(x+y);
   }


  method ---> Return type it is a MUST if you want to return a specific data write the name of that data type
           like for integer write int, for string we write String, if we don't want to return anything we write "void".
           When we write void we can't assign method call to a variable
  add ---> Next we write the name of the method which can be anything but should follow rules of giving names to variables
  () ---> We specify the parameters here , we can pass any data type  inside this parenthesis;
          They are optional , we can leave them empty;

   {System.out.println(x+y);} --> The body of the method that contains the Java statement

Types of Variables in Java

There are 3 Types of variables:Local, Instance, Static.
Local:
  if variable is inside method(or a part of its parameters), in a loop or switch statement, or in if else condition
  it is called local Variable.

Instance:
  if a variable is inside a class but outside any block of code (like method, loop, switch or if statement) it is called
  an Instance variable.

Static:
  if an instance variable has a "static" keyword with it then it is called Static variable.



WHY to learn about different types of variables?
  1)It helps us to reduce us amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be running.
  2)With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class.
  3)Local variables occupy the memory of the shortest period of time and as soon your method is done executing they are destroyed
    by special program called garbage collector

HOW to use them?
 LOCAL: create inside block of code
 (pros: they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time, always try to use local variables when possible)
 (cons: they are very limited in scope, means we can't access them outside of method or that particular block of code)

  Instance: create a variable  inside a class but outside any block of code .
  (pros: they have broader scope as compared to local variables, means we can access in all methods of that class)
  (cons: they occupy space in your RAM for longer periods of time)

  STATIC:
  (pros:we can call static variables without creating an object of a class
        we can share a single variable between all the objects of a class)

***always prefer local variables***
