Types of variables in Java:
   We have 3 types of variables:
Local:
    Are the variables that we declared inside a block
    pros:they occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    cons: they can't be accessed outside that block in which they are created
Instance:
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside of the block of code
    pros: can be accessed in all the methods of a class, they can have different values for each instance of that class
    cons:
Static:
    All the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword are called static variables
    pros: they reserve only a single memory location for all instances of a class
          they can be accessed.
          they have the highest scope and accessibility.
    cons: they always store only one value for all objects of the class.
          they occupy the memory for longest period of time
Real life use:
    Most of th time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
    Static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables.

Access modifiers:
   There are 3 access modifiers keywords( private protected public) and 4 access modifiers levels( private
   protected, default, public)in Java.
Rules:
   Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members of a class( fields and methods)

Private:
    when we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or variable in that class.

Default(its not a keyword):
     when we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or method then default access is applied by Java
     which mean we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other
     classes which exist inside same package.
Public:
    We can use that filed or method anywhere inside the same project( in any packages, any classes)
Real Life Use:
    99% of the time instance fields are  private.
    99% of the time instance and static methods are public.
