What is MethodOverriding:
   -Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.
Why we should override a method:
   -If we are inheriting from a parent class, and we don't like the implementation of a method from the parent class we
    can provide our own implementation, to improve efficiency
   -Sometimes its done to improve the performance of code.
How we can override a method:
   -When we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside child class( numbers of parameters, data type...
   everything has to be the same, only the body and access modifiers can be changed)
Rules:
1) For Override we must inherit from a class.
2) The method int the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same as method in the child class only
   the access modifiers can be different
3) The access modifiers in the parent class can only be increased with respect to visibility for example we can
   change default to protected or to public, but we can't make it private
4) If something is not inherited we can't override it for example private methods and constructors.
5) if a method is static we use a different terminology its called method redeclaration instead of overriding

Example:
class Parent{
 void eat(){
 System.out.println("I like to eat beef");
 }
 void sleep(){
  System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
 }
 }
 class Child extends Parent{
 void eat(){<----we overriding this method
  System.out.println("I like to eat Mutton");
  }

 }
