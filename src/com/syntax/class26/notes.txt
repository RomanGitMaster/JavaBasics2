What is interface?
   -interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class are public static final(constants)
   and all the methods  by default are also public

Why should  we learn about interfaces?
   We can implement abstraction using interfaces.
   When classes are logically connected( means we want to use inheritance) to each other and we want to have instance
   fields( not posible in interface - all fields are constant) and implemented methods as well while doing abstraction
   then we should go with abstract class

How can I use interface ?
   We use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract methods

Rules:
   1) All the fields inside an interface are public static and final
   2) No instance means no constructors are required
   3) no instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract
   4) when we implement the methods from the interface we use implements  keyword.
   5) Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in java.
   6) An interface can extend another interface.
   7) variables in interfaces can't be private, protected or default

4TH PILLAR OF OOP
Encapsulation in Java:
   Is a mechanism that provides us security. If we use encapsulation we can have more security.

How we should use Encapsulation:
   1) make your variables as private,
   2) we should create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields
