Method Overriding:
   When same method exsists in parent and child
Why should we use method overriding?
   Same method can behave differently on different objects. It allows us to achieve the polymorphism.
What is the syntax to achieve method overriding?
   Redefine the method with same header inside the child class

class Parent{
void sleep(){
sout"i sleep 8 hours"
}
}
class Child extends Paren{

void sleep(){
sout"i sleep 6 hours"
}
public static void main(String[]args){
Parent parent=new Child();
parent.sleep();
}
}

Rules:
1) there should be inheritance between classes
2) method header should be same( accesses modifier, return type, method name,parameters)
3) we cannot override something that is not inherited (private methods, constructors)
4) access modifiers in the parent class can only be increased in child class with respect to visibility, for example we can
  change default to protected or to public, but we can't make it private
5) we don't override static methods - we redeclare static methods( override terminology is only applied to instance methods)
6) methods that are declared with final keyword cannot be overridden

public static void main(String[] args){}
Main method is just like any other method, only special about it that all executions start from main method.
We cannot override main method, we redeclare main method, since its static.Just different terminology.

We can overload main method as any other just by changing parameters(data type, sequence, amount of data)

========================================================================================================================
final keyword:
    final in java represent completeness. If something is complete and does not need any modification then we
    use the final keyword with that entity.
1)When final is used wit properties/fields/instance variable we can't reassign those variables.
2)When used with methods these methods can' be overridden in child classes.
3)When used with class names no other class can inherit from that class.
================================================================================================
Abstraction:
    is hiding the implementation details and only showing the functionality.
Why we should use Abstraction:
    with the help of abstraction we can reduce the complexity of code by only focusing on the input/ output
    of a method instead of focusing on the logic of that method.
What is the syntax for abstraction:
    whenever we have to create abstract methods we don't provide the implementation/body of the method
    we  only provide the header of the method and we use the abstract keyword.
Rules:
    1)Abstract methods can't have a body.
    2)Abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    3)Abstract classes can't be instantiated(Can't create the object of that class).
    4)Abstract classes can't be declared final.
    5) we use abstract keyword for abstract classes and methods.
    6) if we inherit,child class has to implement the methods or we can declare the child class as abstract too.
=========================================================================================
interfaces:
    are contracts that classes implement. we can also achieve abstraction with interfaces.
Why should we use interfaces:
    1) They allow multiple inheritance.
    2) They don't have the issue of tightly coupled code.
Syntax to use interface:
    interface nameOfInterface{
    }
Rules:
    1) All variables in interfaces are public static final.
    2) No instance variables.
    3) Constructors are also not allowed.
    4) By default methods are public and abstract.
    5) a single class can implement many interfaces.
    6) an interface can extend another interface.
