Access Modifiers:
   Access modifiers are keywords in java that helps us control the access of classes,
   variables, methods and other code of block.There are 4 access modifiers :Private, Default, Protected and Public.

Private:
   When we use private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible within the same file or class.
   It is most restricted access modifier.
Default(it's not a keyword):
   When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or method then default access is applied by Java
   which mean we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other
   classes which exist inside same package.
Protected:
   When we have protected access modifier we can access the method or variable inside the same class+inside the other classes
   which are inside the same package+ inside the classes which are in different packages as well, but they must have extended relationship
   with the original class
Public:
   We can use that filed or method anywhere inside the same project( in any packages, any classes)
