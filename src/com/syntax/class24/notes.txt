What is Abstraction?
   Abstraction is providing only the neccessary details and hiding all the implementation details.

WHy should we learn Abstraction?
   1) it reduces the complexity by separating the idea from implementation;
   2) it helps us enforce rules and convey our requirements;
How can we use abstraction?
   1) create classes with abstract keyword.
   2) use abstract keyword with method header and don't provide the body of that method inside the parent class.
   3) create child classes and extend those classes from a parent class and implement the abstract methods.
   4) if we don't want to provide implementation one or more methods we can declare the child class as abstract as well
