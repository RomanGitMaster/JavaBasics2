POLYMORPHISM

What is Polymorphism?
   Is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the object or parameters that we pass to a method.
   When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently then Static Polymorphism or Compile Time
   or Early Binding.
   When we achieve the Polymorphism through method overriding then it is called Dynamic or Run Time Polymorphism
   or Late Binding.

Why we should use Polymorphism?
   1) cleaner code.
   2) reliability; we never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something we always want to create
      new methods and new classes. We can call these methods using the parent classes/preference.
   3) we can call multiple methods from many classes with the help of a single variable. Like we can create the array
    of objects and with help of loop will be able to call all the methods from all the classes.

How can we use Polymorphism:
   1) Create a parent child relationship.
   2) Override the methods in the child classes.
   3) Create array of all child classes objects and with help of loop you call all the methods from all the child classes

Rules:
   1) All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the Polymorphism.
   2) We can store the object of a child class inside a variable of type parent class, but we cannot do the reverse
   3) We can create arrays of type parent, and they can hold the objects of child classes.
